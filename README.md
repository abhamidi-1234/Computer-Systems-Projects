1. Linux Shell (Code is private)

Developed a simple Linux shell program (similar to bash), that takes Linux shell commands from a user, parses them, and displays the output in the terminal. It supports a simple form of job control and I/O redirection. It also includes the concepts of process control and signaling.

2. Cache Memory Simulator (Code is private)

Developed a simulator to replicate the behavior of a hardware cache memory using C programming. The program takes a range of values for Set Index, Lines per Set and Block Size as input and reads a stream of Load/Store operations on the cache memory. The program displays the number of Cache Hits, Misses and Evictions.
